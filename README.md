## Explanation

* Create an application that takes a PDF document and the userâ€™s private key to sign the document digitally.
* Create another application/add a feature in the previous app that can verify the signature.
* Add your Github repo for this project to the Excel Spreadsheet distributed earlier.
* Requirements:
  * The signature may be stored in a separate file
    * Extra mark if the signature is embedded in the PDF file
  * The signing app must be able to generate the key pair if the user does not have one
  * Libraries allowed: for generating the key pair, for calculating the hash value, for encryption and decryption
